# Quizzes

There will be a total of five quizzes over the course of the semester, worth a total of 25% of your final grade.  You will have at least two opportunities to score well on each quiz, with a third opportunity for most of them (quiz 1 has 3 attempts built in; quizzes 2-5 will have a single day we you can choose two of them to attempt for a third time.)

## Topics

The five quizzes will follow the topics that we are covering in the course.

Quiz 1 will focus on **C++ Pre-Requisites**, composed entirely of C++ material drawn from CSE 232 or CSE 335 exams (if you cannot do well on this first quiz, you are likely to struggle with the rest of this course).

Quiz 2 will be **C++ Fundamentals**
+ [Sample Quiz 2](sample_quizzes/quiz_2/Quiz2-Example.html)

Quiz 3 will be **Reliable C++ Code**

Quiz 4 will be **Generic C++ Code**

Quiz 5 will be **Efficient C++ Code**.

The advanced topics unit will not have an associated quiz.
