# Quizzes

There will be a total of five quizzes over the course of the semester, worth a total of 25% of your final grade.  You will have at least two opportunities to score well on each quiz, with a third opportunity for most of them (quiz 1 has 3 attempts built in; quizzes 2-5 will have a single day we you can choose two of them to attempt for a third time.)

## Topics

The five quizzes will follow the topics that we are covering in the course.

Quiz 1 focuses on **C++ Pre-Requisites**, composed entirely of C++ material drawn from CSE 232 or CSE 335 exams (if you cannot do well on this first quiz, you are likely to struggle with the rest of this course).
