QuestionText,Why should a class destructor sometimes be marked <code>virtual</code>?,HTML,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,1,,,
Image,,,,
Option,100,If the class is a base class&#44; a virtual destructor ensures that the derived destructor is called when <code>delete</code> is called on a base class pointer,HTML,
Option,0,If you have any other virtual functions in a class&#44; it is an error not to also make the destructor virtual,HTML,
Option,0,You never need to - the compiler will do this automatically if you create any derived class,HTML,
Option,0,All derived classes should have their destructor marked <code>virtual</code> to indicate that they are derived classes,HTML,

Points,1,,,
Difficulty,1,,,
Image,,,,
Option,0,Use std::shared_ptr when you want the object to be modifiable from multiple functions&#44; and std::unique_ptr when modifications should be restricted to one module.,HTML,
Option,0,Use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> when you are working with smaller objects&#44; but use and <code>std::shared_ptr</code> when the object is large or expensive to copy.,HTML,
Option,0,Use <code>std::shared_ptr</code> for polymorphic objects since they require dynamic management&#44; and use std::unique_ptr only for non-polymorphic types.,HTML,
Option,100,Use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> by default because it is more efficient and less likely to leak memory; only use std::shared_ptr when you need to share ownership across multiple parts of your program.,HTML,
Option,0,Use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> if you know you are going to have only one instance of a class&#44; but used <code>std::shared_ptr</code> if you are likely to have many instances.,HTML,
