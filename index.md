### Required Technology
Students are expected to bring a laptop running a modern operating system (Windows, MacOS or Linux) to each class session. This laptop must be capable of running a modern C++ compiler and have access to the web.

### Description
Students will develop large C++ projects and gain expertise with the language. Topics include modern features of C++, effective use of the standard library, and developing custom libraries, with links to other areas of computer science. Emphasis will be placed on writing code that is secure, reliable, efficient, and generic, including good memory management practices, avoiding undefined behavior, automating through testing, and up-to-date documentation. 

### Pre-requisites
Understanding of C++ basics (as taught in CSE 232 and CSE 335), completion of all 300-level CSE requirements and at least two other 400-level CSE courses.

### Teaching Style
This course will be taught using a “flipped classroom” methodology. Students will be expected to watch provided videos (or read assigned web pages) before each class session. Sessions will briefly review these topics, but focus on discussion of concepts and live implementation, debugging, or code reviews, as well as quizzes, small group discussions, and student presentations of their progress. The course [schedule](schedule.html) will include the required material at least a week before it is due (and likely much sooner than that).

## Grading
In this course you will have the opportunity to earn up to 100 points toward your final grade.  Grades will be based on:

| **Project**        | 45 points |
| **Quizzes**        | 25 points (5 quizzes at 5 points each) |
| **Weekly Updates** | 12 points |
| **Peer Reviews**   | 12 points |
| **Participation Questions** | 6 points |
| **TOTAL**          | 100 points |

Each area is important: If you get fewer than half the points in any single category, that is grounds for receiving a zero as a final course grade. You will need 90 of the 100 possible points to guarantee a 4.0, 85 points for 3.5, 80 points for 3.0, 75 points for 2.5, 70 points for 2.0, 65 points for 1.5, and 60 points for 1.0.

You will need 90 of the 100 possible points to guarantee a 4.0, 86 points for 3.5, 82 points for 3.0, 78 points for 2.5, 74 points for 2.0, 70 points for 1.5, and 66 points for 1.0.

### [Project](projects.html)
You will work in a group on a semester-long project. You may earn up to 45 points this way, based on both consistent progress and the quality of the final product. Your final project grade will be based on three main factors: Functionality (Meeting the project goals), Code Quality (Consistent style, documentation, function modularity, file layout, test coverage, etc.), and your Individual Contributions (Teammate ratings, info in weekly progress reports, and git logs).

### [Weekly Updates](updates.html)
Each Friday before midnight (starting in week 2) students will be expected to turn in a weekly progress reports.  Each report must contain four sections:
+ What did you work on this past week?
+ What do you plan to work on next week?
+ Are you facing any challenges with the project?
+ Are the other members of your group consistently participating?

Some reports might have extra specific questions that you will be told at least 48 hours ahead of time. Reports are worth 1 point each and will be graded on a pass/fail basis (honest attempts will be given a "pass" as long as problems are corrected in future reports). Overall you are expected to turn in 14 of these reports, but a maximum of 12 points will count toward your final grade, so two can be missed without penalty.

### [Quizzes](quizzes.html)
There will be five quizzes over the course of the semester. You will have three attempts at versions of each quiz with only the highest score counting toward your final grade (at 5% per quiz). Quizzes will occur each Wednesday for the first 20 minutes of class.

### [Peer Reviews](reviews.html)
At three points during the semester you will be expect to conduct a peer review of another group's project, identifying potential problems and making suggestions for improvement. You will be provided with a specific rubric to follow and are expected to do a detailed review.  You will be granted up to four points per review. The group being reviewed will have an opportunity to fix any identified problems before being graded by the instructors.

### Participation Questions
During class we will discuss that session’s material in addition to doing live coding, code review, quizzes, etc. In order to understand and be able to contribute to the discussion, you will be expected to watch videos before each class. To ensure that you watch the videos, we will ask you a multiple-choice question about them on at least 8 occasions. These questions should be easy if you watched the video, but impossible to answer confidently otherwise (e.g., “Which of the following example problems was used throughout the video?”). Each correct answer will earn you 1 point to a maximum of 6 points for the semester (so you can get 2 wrong and still get a perfect score).

**A note about participation**: If you engage in conversation, you provide us with another source of information as to how well you are learning the material, and how much effort you are putting into the course. Let's have an active class! Class participation will never harm your grade; always ask any questions you may have about the material.

## Academic Dishonesty
Unlike most CSE classes, we encourage you to discuss any course material with each other and even make extensive use of outside sources including AI systems. The main issues that you need to be careful about are that you provide appropriate credit (i.e., cite your sources and do not claim someone else's work as your own) and that you take any in-class quizzes or participation questions on your own without getting help from anyone else. While it is okay to use previously written code or AI-generated code (with citations in either case), your project group is responsible for generating the bulk of new code that you use. Furthermore, you are responsible for fully understanding all code that you use -- do not just insert code because it works; make sure you know _why_ it works.

Because a primary goal of this course is to teach professionalism, any academic dishonesty will be grounds for receiving a failing grade for the semester. Specific examples of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited to):
+ Copying another student’s quiz answers.
+ Using code or text not written by someone in your group without attributing credit (i.e., you can use tools, libraries, code snippits from the web, or even LLMs, but tell us!)
+ Asking (or, worse, paying) someone outside of the course to write project code for you.
+ Including code as your own that no one in your group understands (you must be able to explain, at least at a high level, any code that you use.)
+ Providing false information to an instructor about matters related to the course.
+ Facilitating another student in committing academic dishonesty.

## General Note
The goals of this class is for you to (1) learn how to write C++ code that is safe, efficient, and reliable; (2) improve your ability to write about computational topics, and (3) develop strong teamwork capabilities. If anything is getting in your way of these goals, please talk with us. We plan to keep the class flexible to the learning styles that seem to work best for the students, so feedback is always appreciated.
