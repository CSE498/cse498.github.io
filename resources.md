# Additional Resources

Lots of useful links and bonus videos below.  These resources will be expanded as the semester progresses.  Please make suggestions if you find a website or C++ video that you think is valuable!

## Web Resources

[CPP Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/) - A community-driven resource with a detailed guide to the C++ language.

[https://www.learncpp.com/](https://www.learncpp.com/) - Useful site for learning C++ from scratch.

[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) - Compile and run C++ code on the internet, try out different compilers, see the resulting assembly code, and share the results.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Useful question and answer site for programming, with somewhat peer-reviewed results.  Answers tend to be higher quality than other sites.

[CPP Insights](https://cppinsights.io/) - See how a compiler views your C++ code.  Helps spell out many of the implicit assumptions that you might be making.

[The C++ Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp) - New, useful resources are often announced here, along with interesting discussions about the C++ language.

[C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) - A set of guidelines to help you leverage "modern" C++.

[C++ Cheat Sheets](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/cheat_sheets.html) - A bunch of quick references for how to use C++ and especially the standard library.

[C++ Quiz](https://cppquiz.org/quiz/random) - A random question about C++ (1 to 3 dot difficulty; 3 dots is VERY hard.)

## Video suggestions

On the class [schedule](schedule.md) you will see class-by-class videos to watch for discussion.  Here are some additional videos that were informative.  


### Week 3 Extras

[C++ Standard Views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv29fo9sUjY) (96 min) - A much more detailed review of tricks and possibilities with views.  I learned a lot from this video, but it is long and goes into lots of detail, so I elected not to include it in the main course.

### Week 10 Extras

**[What Programmers should Know about Memory Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYfd25Bdmws)**. Goes into more detail about memory allocation especially when working with multi-threaded programs.  Some of the speed improvements they are able to demonstrate are really impressive.

### Week 11 Extras

**[Modern Template Metaprogramming: A Compendium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am2is2QCvxY)**.  This is an old video (covering through C++14), but all of the techniques still work and many are now baked in to the standard library.  It has a lot of obscure knowledge about how C++ works that many of you will find fascinating.
