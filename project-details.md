# Project Group Info

Each group is provided a set of class modules that it will be expected to develop, along with a suggestion for a final project that can use those modules.  Groups are named after famous computer scientists.

## Group 1: Stroustrup

**Shared Interests**: Data Processing

**Notable Strengths**: Databases, Web Development

### Classes to Build

| Class               | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **`Distribution`**  | Create or manage a discrete distribution of values that can be used (with random numbers) to draw from whatever distribution you need. (for example, a Binomial distribution) |
| **`Graph`**         | A class to manage a collection of vertices and edges; should be useful for conducting simple algorithms. |
| **`GraphPosition`** | A position on the Graph object, useful for implementing more complex graph algorithms. |
| **`Random`**        | A random number generator.  User should supply the range and numerical type and the object should return a uniform random value in that range. |
| **`StaticVector`**  | Like an std::vector, but a maximum number of entries is set up front and all memory is allocated at compile time.  Size cannot go over the static limit. |

### Application Suggestion

A **graph generator and analyzer**.  The user would be able to specify the type of graph they want, as well as the size and any other relevant parameters (for example, width and height in a grid, or number of edges in a random graph).  The app will create the graph and be able to provide information about some key properties of the graph, such as average degree of vertices, height of its minimum spanning tree, etc.
